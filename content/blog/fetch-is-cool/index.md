[Here's a quick video of all of that ðŸ‘‡](https://soapbox.wistia.com/videos/VrE8ENWSQ8)

If youâ€™ve sent or received data from somewhere, youâ€™ve likely used an XMLHttpRequest. Or if youâ€™re a jQuery junkie, youâ€™ve used $.ajax({ â€¦ }). An XMLHttpRequest looks like this:

Pretty simple, check the console for the time. I ran it 10 times on Chrome and got an average of ~ 0.394ms using [console.time()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/time).

## Now letâ€™s look at fetch()
The fetch() method is pretty simple. It only requires the path to the thing you want to fetch. In return, you get a promise that can be resolved to the response, telling you whether it worked or not.

If you were to just do this

and displayed it somehow, youâ€™d get [object Promise]. So after you evaluate the promise, you get the response object.

The response body exposes a [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) of the body contents. So how do you get the actual contents? You want [Body.json()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Body/json). The Body is actually a mixin that takes a Response stream, but weâ€™ll talk about mixins another time. So the .json() function returns a promise that evaluates to the actual stuff you want.

So, to chain them all together, you can do something like this:

If you havenâ€™t used ansyc / await patterns, you should start now. Youâ€™re probably already pretty familiar with the async part, and the await part is pretty simple to understand at face value too.

Give a promise to await, and itâ€™ll give you the fulfilled value.

When making a function async, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function, pass it a promise (like whatâ€™s return from both fetch() and json()), and youâ€™ll get what you want.

So, that chain above would look like this:

One bummer â€” IE doesnâ€™t support it. But thereâ€™s a [polyfill from GitHub](https://github.com/github/fetch) that helps you out.

So, fetch() is pretty great.
